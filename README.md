# Bruinen API Sources

This repository is for open-source contributions to Bruinen's growing list of profile sources.

Bruinen is on a mission to change the way user's interact with the internet. This starts with user identity, giving them the richest possible profile, and putting them in the drivers seat. 

To create a rich set of user profile information, Bruinen integrates with a variety of other sites where the user could have a profile.

Here are some of the available sources:
